# Noise Filter
Tool used for filtering noise in audio files
## Two approaches
- **Time domain** analysis using the convolution function
- **Frequency domain** analysis using the filter function
## Types of filters
We split the time/frequency graph into 3 regions and apply the appropriate filters
1. **Lowpass** Filter out higher frequencies
2. **Bandpass** Exclude abnormal noises by allowing a specific range of freuqencies
3. **Highpass** Exclude lower frequencies
